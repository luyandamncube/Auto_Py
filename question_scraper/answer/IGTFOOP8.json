{"question": "Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that mightmeet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.After you answer a question in this scenario, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.You plan to create an Azure Databricks workspace that has a tiered structure. The workspace will contain the following three workloads:A workload for data engineers who will use Python and SQLA workload for jobs that will run notebooks that use Python, Spark, Scala, and SQLA workload that data scientists will use to perform ad hoc analysis in Scala and RThe enterprise architecture team at your company identifies the following standards for Databricks environments:The data engineers must share a cluster.The job cluster will be managed by using a request process whereby data scientists and data engineers provide packaged notebooks for deployment to thecluster.All the data scientists must be assigned their own cluster that terminates automatically after 120 minutes of inactivity. Currently, there are three data scientists.You need to create the Databrick clusters for the workloads.Solution: You create a Standard cluster for each data scientist, a High Concurrency cluster for the data engineers, and a Standard cluster for the jobs.Does this meet the goal?\nA.Yes\nB.No", "answer": "B", "description": "We would need a High Concurrency cluster for the jobs.Note: Standard clusters are recommended for a single user. Standard can run workloads developed in any language: Python, R, Scala, and SQL.A high concurrency cluster is a managed cloud resource. The key benefits of high concurrency clusters are that they provide Apache Spark-native fine-grainedsharing for maximum resource utilization and minimum query latencies.References:https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/clusters/configure.html"}
