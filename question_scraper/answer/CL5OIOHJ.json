{"question": "You have an Azure SQL database that has masked columns.You need to identify when a user attempts to infer data from the masked columns.What should you use?\nA.Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)\nB.custom masking rules\nC.Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)\nD.auditing", "answer": "D", "description": "Dynamic Data Masking is designed to simplify application development by limiting data exposure in a set of pre-defined queries used by the application. WhileDynamic Data Masking can also be useful to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data when accessing a production database directly, it is important to notethat unprivileged users with ad-hoc query permissions can apply techniques to gain access to the actual data. If there is a need to grant such ad-hoc access,Auditing should be used to monitor all database activity and mitigate this scenario.References:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking"}
