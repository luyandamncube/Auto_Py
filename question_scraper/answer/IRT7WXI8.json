Usually these tables connect to more than one fact tablesand optimizing for one join may not be the best idea. Also usually dimension tables are smaller which can leave some distributions empty when hash distributed.Round-robin by definition guarantees a uniform data distribution.References:https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlcat/2015/08/11/choosing-hash-distributed-table-vs-round-robin-distributed-table-in-azure-sql-dw-service/"}
