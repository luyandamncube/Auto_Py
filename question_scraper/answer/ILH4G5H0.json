We have three resources in this scenario for which linkedservices are needed:On-premises SQL ServerAzure Blob StorageAzure SQL databaseNote: Azure Data Factory is a fully managed cloud-based data integration service that orchestrates and automates the movement and transformation of data. Thekey concept in the ADF model is pipeline. A pipeline is a logical grouping of Activities, each of which defines the actions to perform on the data contained inDatasets. Linked services are used to define the information needed for Data Factory to connect to the data resources.References:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/move-sql-azure-adf"}
