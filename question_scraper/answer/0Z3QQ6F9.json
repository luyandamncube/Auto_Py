{"question": "You are a data architect. The data engineering team needs to configure a synchronization of data between an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server database to AzureSQL Database.Ad-hoc and reporting queries are being overutilized the on-premises production instance. The synchronization process must:Perform an initial data synchronization to Azure SQL Database with minimal downtimePerform bi-directional data synchronization after initial synchronizationYou need to implement this synchronization solution.   Which synchronization method should you use?\nA.transactional replication\nB.Data Migration Assistant (DMA)\nC.backup and restore\nD.SQL Server Agent job\nE.Azure SQL Data Sync", "answer": "E", "description": "SQL Data Sync is a service built on Azure SQL Database that lets you synchronize the data you select bi-directionally across multiple SQL databases and SQLServer instances.With Data Sync, you can keep data synchronized between your on-premises databases and Azure SQL databases to enable hybrid applications.Compare Data Sync with Transactional ReplicationReferences:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-sync-data"}
