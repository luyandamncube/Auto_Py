The storage must be available in the event of a regional disaster. The solution mustminimize costs.DeploymentsAll deployments must be performed by using Azure DevOps. Deployments must use templates used in multiple environmentsNo credentials or secrets should be used during deploymentsReliabilityAll services and processes must be resilient to a regional Azure outage.MonitoringAll Azure services must be monitored by using Azure Monitor.
