{"question": "You plan to implement an Azure Cosmos DB database that will write 100,000 JSON every 24 hours. The database will be replicated to three regions. Only oneregion will be writable.You need to select a consistency level for the database to meet the following requirements:Guarantee monotonic reads and writes within a session.Provide the fastest throughput.Provide the lowest latency.Which consistency level should you select?\nA.Strong\nB.Bounded Staleness\nC.Eventual\nD.Session\nE.Consistent Prefix", "answer": "D", "description": "Session: Within a single client session reads are guaranteed to honor the consistent-prefix (assuming a single \ufb01writer\ufb02 session), monotonic reads, monotonic writes,read-your-writes, and write-follows-reads guarantees. Clients outside of the session performing writes will see eventual consistency.References:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels"}
