{"question": "HOTSPOTYou are designing a new Lambda architecture on Microsoft Azure.The real-time processing layer must meet the following requirements:Ingestion:Receive millions of events per secondAct as a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutionIntegrate with Azure FunctionsStream processing:Process on a per-job basisProvide seamless connectivity with Azure servicesUse a SQL-based query languageAnalytical data store:Act as a managed serviceUse a document storeProvide data encryption at restYou need to identify the correct technologies to build the Lambda architecture using minimal effort. Which technologies should you use? To answer, select theappropriate options in the answer area.NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.Hot Area:", "answer": "", "description": "Box 1: Azure Event HubsThis portion of a streaming architecture is often referred to as stream buffering. Options include Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, and Kafka.Incorrect Answers: Not HDInsight KafkaAzure Functions need a trigger defined in order to run. There is a limited set of supported trigger types, and Kafka is not one of them.Box 2: Azure Stream AnalyticsAzure Stream Analytics provides a managed stream processing service based on perpetually running SQL queries that operate on unbounded streams.You can also use open source Apache streaming technologies like Storm and Spark Streaming in an HDInsight cluster.Box 3: Azure SQL Data WarehouseAzure SQL Data Warehouse provides a managed service for large-scale, cloud-based data warehousing. HDInsight supports Interactive Hive, HBase, and SparkSQL, which can also be used to serve data for analysis.References:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/"}
