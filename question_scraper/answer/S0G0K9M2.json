Determinewhether the solution meets the stated goals.You develop data engineering solutions for a company.A project requires the deployment of resources to Microsoft Azure for batch data processing on Azure HDInsight. Batch processing will run daily and must:Scale to minimize costsBe monitored for cluster performanceYou need to recommend a tool that will monitor clusters and provide information to suggest how to scale.Solution: Monitor clusters by using Azure Log Analytics and HDInsight cluster management solutions.Does the solution meet the goal?\nA.Yes\nB.No", "answer": "A", "description": "HDInsight provides cluster-specific management solutions that you can add for Azure Monitor logs. Management solutions add functionality to Azure Monitor logs,providing additional data and analysis tools. These solutions collect important performance metrics from your HDInsight clusters and provide the tools to search themetrics. These solutions also provide visualizations and dashboards for most cluster types supported in HDInsight. By using the metrics that you collect with thesolution, you can create custom monitoring rules and alerts.References:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-oms-log-analytics-tutorial"}
