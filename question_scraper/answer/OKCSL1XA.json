{"question": "A company plans to use Azure SQL Database to support a mission-critical application.The application must be highly available without performance degradation during maintenance windows.You need to implement the solution.Which three technologies should you implement? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\nA.Premium service tier\nB.Virtual machine Scale Sets\nC.Basic service tier\nD.SQL Data Sync\nE.Always On availability groups\nF.Zone-redundant configuration", "answer": "AEF", "description": "A: Premium/business critical service tier model that is based on a cluster of database engine processes. This architectural model relies on a fact that there isalways a quorum of available database engine nodes and has minimal performance impact on your workload even during maintenance activities.E: In the premium model, Azure SQL database integrates compute and storage on the single node. High availability in this architectural model is achieved byreplication of compute (SQL Server Database Engine process) and storage (locally attached SSD) deployed in 4-node cluster, using technology similar to SQLServer Always On Availability Groups.F: Zone redundant configurationBy default, the quorum-set replicas for the local storage configurations are created in the same datacenter. With the introduction of Azure Availability Zones, youhave the ability to place the different replicas in the quorum-sets to different availability zones in the same region. To eliminate a single point of failure, the controlring is also duplicated across multiple zones as three gateway rings (GW).References:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-high-availability"}
