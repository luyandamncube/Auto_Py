{"question": "A company has a Microsoft Azure HDInsight solution that uses different cluster types to process and analyze data. Operations are continuous.Reports indicate slowdowns during a specific time window.You need to determine a monitoring solution to track down the issue in the least amount of time.What should you use?\nA.Azure Log Analytics log search query\nB.Ambari REST API\nC.Azure Monitor Metrics\nD.HDInsight .NET SDK\nE.Azure Log Analytics alert rule query", "answer": "B", "description": "Ambari is the recommended tool for monitoring the health for any given HDInsight cluster.Note: Azure HDInsight is a high-availability service that has redundant gateway nodes, head nodes, and ZooKeeper nodes to keep your HDInsight clusters runningsmoothly. While this ensures that a single failure will not affect the functionality of a cluster, you may still want to monitor cluster health so you are alerted when anissue does arise. Monitoring cluster health refers to monitoring whether all nodes in your cluster and the components that run on them are available and functioningcorrectly.Ambari is the recommended tool for monitoring utilization across the whole cluster. The Ambari dashboard shows easily glanceable widgets that display metricssuch as CPU, network, YARN memory, and HDFS disk usage. The specific metrics shown depend on cluster type. The \ufb01Hosts\ufb02 tab shows metrics for individualnodes so you can ensure the load on your cluster is evenly distributed.References:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/monitoring-on-hdinsight-part-1-an-overview/"}
