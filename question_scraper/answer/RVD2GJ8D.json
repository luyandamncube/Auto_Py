{"question": "You plan to use Microsoft Azure SQL Database instances with strict user access control. A user object must:Move with the database if it is run elsewhereBe able to create additional usersYou need to create the user object with correct permissions.Which two Transact-SQL commands should you run? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\nA.ALTER LOGIN Mary WITH PASSWORD = 'strong_password';\nB.CREATE LOGIN Mary WITH PASSWORD = 'strong_password';\nC.ALTER ROLE db_owner ADD MEMBER Mary;\nD.CREATE USER Mary WITH PASSWORD = 'strong_password';\nE.GRANT ALTER ANY USER TO Mary;", "answer": "CD", "description": "C: ALTER ROLE adds or removes members to or from a database role, or changes the name of a user-defined database role.Members of the db_owner fixed database role can perform all configuration and maintenance activities on the database, and can also drop the database in SQLServer.D: CREATE USER adds a user to the current database.Note: Logins are created at the server level, while users are created at the database level. In other words, a login allows you to connect to the SQL Server service(also called an instance), and permissions inside the database are granted to the database users, not the logins. The logins will be assigned to server roles (forexample, serveradmin) and the database users will be assigned to roles within that database (eg. db_datareader, db_bckupoperator).References:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-role-transact-sqlhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-user-transact-sqlTestlet 2OverviewCurrent environmentContoso relies on an extensive partner network for marketing, sales, and distribution. Contoso uses external companies that manufacture everything from the actualpharmaceutical to the packaging.The majority of the company\u2122s data reside in Microsoft SQL Server database. Application databases fall into one of the following tiers:The company has a reporting infrastructure that ingests data from local databases and partner services. Partners services consists of distributors, wholesales, andretailers across the world. The company performs daily, weekly, and monthly reporting.RequirementsTier 3 and Tier 6 through Tier 8 application must use database density on the same server and Elastic pools in a cost-effective manner.Applications must still have access to data from both internal and external applications keeping the data encrypted and secure at rest and in transit.A disaster recovery strategy must be implemented for Tier 3 and Tier 6 through 8 allowing for failover in the case of server going offline.Selected internal applications must have the data hosted in single Microsoft Azure SQL Databases.Tier 1 internal applications on the premium P2 tierTier 2 internal applications on the standard S4 tierThe solution must support migrating databases that support external and internal application to Azure SQL Database. The migrated databases will be supported byAzure Data Factory pipelines for the continued movement, migration and updating of data both in the cloud and from local core business systems and repositories.Tier 7 and Tier 8 partner access must be restricted to the database only.In addition to default Azure backup behavior, Tier 4 and 5 databases must be on a backup strategy that performs a transaction log backup eve hour, a differentialbackup of databases every day and a full back up every week.Back up strategies must be put in place for all other standalone Azure SQL Databases using Azure SQL-provided backup storage and capabilities.DatabasesContoso requires their data estate to be designed and implemented in the Azure Cloud. Moving to the cloud must not inhibit access to or availability of data.Databases:Tier 1 Database must implement data masking using the following masking logic:Tier 2 databases must sync between branches and cloud databases and in the event of conflicts must be set up for conflicts to be won by on-premises databases.Tier 3 and Tier 6 through Tier 8 applications must use database density on the same server and Elastic pools in a cost-effective manner.Applications must still have access to data from both internal and external applications keeping the data encrypted and secure at rest and in transit.A disaster recovery strategy must be implemented for Tier 3 and Tier 6 through 8 allowing for failover in the case of a server going offline.Selected internal applications must have the data hosted in single Microsoft Azure SQL Databases.Tier 1 internal applications on the premium P2 tierTier 2 internal applications on the standard S4 tierReportingSecurity and monitoringSecurityA method of managing multiple databases in the cloud at the same time is must be implemented to streamlining data management and limiting managementaccess to only those requiring access.MonitoringMonitoring must be set up on every database. Contoso and partners must receive performance reports as part of contractual agreements.Tiers 6 through 8 must have unexpected resource storage usage immediately reported to data engineers.The Azure SQL Data Warehouse cache must be monitored when the database is being used. A dashboard monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) indicatedby traffic lights must be created and displayed based on the following metrics:Existing Data Protection and Security compliances require that all certificates and keys are internally managed in an on-premises storage.You identify the following reporting requirements:Azure Data Warehouse must be used to gather and query data from multiple internal and external databasesAzure Data Warehouse must be optimized to use data from a cacheReporting data aggregated for external partners must be stored in Azure Storage and be made available during regular business hours in the connecting regionsReporting strategies must be improved to real time or near real time reporting cadence to improve competitiveness and the general supply chainTier 9 reporting must be moved to Event Hubs, queried, and persisted in the same Azure region as the company\u2122s main officeTier 10 reporting data must be stored in Azure BlobsIssuesTeam members identify the following issues:Both internal and external client application run complex joins, equality searches and group-by clauses. Because some systems are managed externally, thequeries will not be changed or optimized by ContosoExternal partner organization data formats, types and schemas are controlled by the partner companiesInternal and external database development staff resources are primarily SQL developers familiar with the Transact-SQL language.Size and amount of data has led to applications and reporting solutions not performing are required speedsTier 7 and 8 data access is constrained to single endpoints managed by partners for accessThe company maintains several legacy client applications. Data for these applications remains isolated form other applications. This has led to hundreds ofdatabases being provisioned on a per application basis"}
